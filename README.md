# Canvas Static Drawing Starter
This starter template project is a part of *GB Dev School* initiative by Grigoriy Beziuk (@gbezyuk).

## Purpose
To allow students to:
* practice 2D drawing using JavaScript and 2D Canvas

## Prerequisites
* some very basic JavaScript familiarity
* basic written English skills, obviously
* some enthusiasm ;)

## How to use
1. Fork/clone this repo, or download a release and unarchive it.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser; you should see a black rectangle.
3. Open `scripts/payload/drawing.js` in your favorite text/code editor, and start hacking.


## Sample Problems

For all the problems below, the student is supposed to edit `scripts/payload/drawing.js` only.

### 1. Simple Canvas Drawing

You could find this useful: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial

Just try drawing different planar figures.

### 2. Going functional

Create a number of functions that draw specific non-trivial figures
* with given properties (like size and color)
* at given coordinates.
Like `drawFunnyFace (x, y, size, lipsColor, eyesColor)`. Feel free to experiment.

### 3. Going recursive. Simple Fractals.

* Start with drawing a concentric shooting target
* Draw a [Sierpiński carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_carpet)
* Draw a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)
  (iterating from a square or using proper triangles)
* Maybe go kinda crazy with an [Apollonian gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket)?
* Look, there are [MANY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension) fractals to get inspired by!
